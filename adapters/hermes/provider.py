#: ``sync_turn`` only after a turn with a message and a reply: a turn it injected (a watch notification), one it
#: interrupted, or one with no reply ran no retry.  An idle agent evicted from Hermes' cache keeps its adapter without
#: a shutdown, so nothing wrote the buffer again until a gateway restart dropped it.  tianji lost 10 tool results so on
